In this task, I learned a lot about open-source projects, how they work, and how to contribute to them. 
I also explored Google Dorking, a technique for using Google search to find specific information.
What I've learnt:
To start with ,I learnt about the open-source licenses:
each has its own rules.
(1)MIT license: its basically open. It lets anyone use, modify, and share the software as long as they keep the
original license.

(2)GPL: General public license,it makes sure that any changes to the software must also be open-source.

(3)BSD license :BSD License: The BSD License is another permissive license like MIT but with some additional conditions 
about redistribution. It’s used fora more flexible licensing approach .

(4)Apache license:Similar to the MIT License but it has extra rules about patents. 

(5)MPL LICENSE: Mozilla Public License,it allows users to modify and redistribute the software, but it requires
that any modifications to the original code be released under the same license.

others include creative commmons etc


we choose licenses based on the goals of our project and how open or restricted our project should be.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO OPEN-SOURCE PROJECTS?
(1)FORKING: The first step is usually to fork (copy) the project’s repository to our own account.

(2)make changes:after the first step of forking ,you can work on bugs and fixing them,adding features etc.

(3)pull requests:Once changes are made,we submit a pull request to ask the project maintainers to review 
our changes and also add them to the main project.

(4)Merging: If everything looks fine, our changes are merged into the main project

KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM STUDYING REACT:
For this task, I decided to study React, a popular JavaScript library used to build user interfaces.
License: React uses the MIT License which has a very few restrictions.
Contribution Guidelines: React’s contribution guidelines are clear Contributors are required to fork the project,
create a new branch for their changesand write clear commit messages.
Documentation: React’s documentation is good and organised.
GitHub and the Reactworks together.

GOOGLE DORKING:
Google Dorking is a technique used to search for specific information using advanced Google search operators. 
It’s mainly used in security research to find hidden files or vulnerabilities if any
like we can use operators like filetype:pdf to find PDF files or intitle:login to find login pages.
I learned about this technique in the TryHackMe Google Dorking room. While it’s a useful tool for
ethical hacking, it can also be misused. It’s important to always get permission before using Google Dorking
for testing any system.
